This is an app to know the weather details of any location around the world. Temperature along with description, country code and emoji's will de displayed.
I have used an API key from openweather.org. This project using async JS.
This app may not work now as I'm still figuring out how to hide the API keys.
 Sorry for the inconvenience. 
 
 Thanks,
 Seethal
